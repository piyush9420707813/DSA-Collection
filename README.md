# üìö DSA with Java ‚Äì Problem Solving Journey üöÄ

Welcome to my personal repository where I‚Äôm documenting my journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java.

This repo is a collection of handpicked problems I‚Äôve solved from various platforms like LeetCode, CodeStudio, GeeksforGeeks, and more ‚Äî along with my own notes, logic, and explanations.

## üß† Why this Repository?

While completing the **Alpha (DSA with Java)** course by [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/c/ApnaCollegeOfficial), I realized:
> üß© "DSA isn't something you finish ‚Äî it's something you grow with."

So, I started this repo to:
- Track my daily practice
- Refactor and revisit past problems
- Build a strong foundation for placements and real-world problem-solving
- Share handwritten notes for quick revision and better understanding

## üìù Handwritten Notes

To make learning more intuitive, I‚Äôve added **handwritten notes** alongside code ‚Äî perfect for:
- Quick revisions
- Visual learners
- Offline reference during interviews

You'll find these inside each topic folder, named clearly as `Notes.pdf` or `Topic-Notes.png`.

## üìÜ Progress

I aim to solve at least **2-3 problems daily**, focusing on both basic and advanced patterns.

- üß© Total Problems Solved: `100+` 
- üí° Level: Easy to Hard

## ‚ö° Final Note

This repo is not about showing off solved problems.  
It‚Äôs about **consistency**, **discipline**, and the **mindset** to solve problems better every day.

> "DSA is not a milestone. It‚Äôs a habit."
